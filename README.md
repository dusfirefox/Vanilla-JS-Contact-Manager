# Vanilla JS Contact Manager App

A clean and simple web-based contact manager application. This project allows users to add, display, and delete contacts. The application is built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses the browser's `localStorage` to ensure that contacts are saved and persist between sessions.

## Key Features

  * **Create, Read, & Delete (CRD):** Add new contacts, view them in a list, and delete them.
  * **Persistent Storage:** Contacts are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so your list is saved even after you close the tab.
  * **Dynamic UI:** The contact list is dynamically rendered. New contacts appear and disappear instantly without a page reload.
  * **Theme Toggler:** Includes a built-in light/dark mode theme switcher that also saves the user's preference in `localStorage`.
  * **Modern Styling:** A responsive, soft-UI (neumorphic) design built with modern CSS (Flexbox and CSS Variables).
  * **No Frameworks:** Built with 100% "vanilla" JavaScript—no external libraries or frameworks needed for the core logic.
